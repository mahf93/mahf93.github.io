I am a Machine Learning PhD student at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). I am interested in the generalization ability of deep neural networks with a particular focus on classification tasks with limited and/or noisy-labeled datasets. In my research, I focus on finding techniques that require no access to ground truth labels while being informative about the model generalization and the dataset itself.
